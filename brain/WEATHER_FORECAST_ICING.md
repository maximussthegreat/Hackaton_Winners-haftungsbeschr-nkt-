# HPA METEOROLOGICAL ALERT: SECTOR 4 (SÜDERELBE)

**ISSUED:** 2026-02-01 10:00 UTC
**VALID:** T+0h to T+24h
**SOURCE:** Sentinel Environmental Module (Polaris-7)

## ⚠️  SEVERE WEATHER WARNING: FLASH FREEZE

### 1. Situation Analysis

A localized high-pressure cold front is converging with tidal flux in the **Köhlbrand** and **Rethe** channels. Water temperatures are projected to drop from **2.4°C** to **-1.8°C** within the next 4 hours (T+4.0h).

### 2. Anomaly Detection (Ice Accretion)

* **Prediction Confidence:** 94.2% (High)
* **Phenomenon:** "Pancake Ice" formation combined with increasing drift ice from upstream.
* **Impact Zone:** Kattwyk Bridge Pylons & Rethe Bascule Mechanism.

### 3. Operational Risk

* **Bridge Sensors:** Risk of hydraulic locking due to ice jam.
* **Vessel Traffic:** Heavy cargo vessels (Convoy A/B) arriving at **T+5.0h** will require tug assistance to navigate ice flows.
* **Infrastructure:** Kattwyk Bridge must remain **CLOSED** (Locked Down) to prevent mechanism failure during ice loading.

### 4. AI Recommendation

* **Protocol:** WINTER-ALPHA-9
* **Action:** Immediate suspension of bridge lifts. Reroute all heavy vehicle traffic.
* **Alert Level:** RED
