SYSTEM STATUS: OPERATIONAL
==========================

The previous issues have been resolved.

1.  SIMULATION REMOVED: The system no longer relies on hardcoded ship lists.
2.  REAL DATA INTEGRATED: We are streaming live data from the Port of Hamburg.
3.  CRASHES FIXED: The startup sequence is stable.

This project is now in "REAL MODE".
