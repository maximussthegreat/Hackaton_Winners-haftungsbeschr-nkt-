# Multi-Layered Urban Systems Analysis: Hamburg (January 30–31, 2026)

## 1. Introduction: The Convergence of Geospatial, Meteorological, and Logistical Data

The analysis of a complex metropolitan organism like Hamburg requires the synchronization of three distinct but deeply interconnected data planes: the static geospatial framework (the vector map), the dynamic environmental forcing (meteorology), and the resultant kinetic flow (traffic and logistics). For the observation period of January 30 through January 31, 2026, these three planes intersected to create a highly specific operational environment. The Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, functioning as both a federal state and Germany's largest maritime gateway, presents a unique challenge in data retrieval and synthesis due to the decoupling of its administrative data (ALKIS) from its open-source mapping counterparts (OpenStreetMap) and the proprietary nature of its real-time traffic sensor network.

This report serves as a comprehensive technical reconstruction of the city's status during this 48-hour window. It establishes the precise methodologies for acquiring and processing vector cartography that rigorously separates hydrological features from terrestrial and transportation networks. It subsequently overlays a high-fidelity reconstruction of the atmospheric column based on Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) station observations, identifying critical windows of freezing precipitation that acted as capacity constraints on the road network. Finally, it synthesizes the historic traffic load by correlating induction loop metadata with the deterministic demand generated by port logistics—specifically the arrival of Ultra-Large Container Vessels (ULCVs) such as the ONE Triumph and the HMM Oslo during the target timeframe.

The synthesis reveals that traffic patterns on January 30, 2026, were not merely a function of commuter demand but were heavily modulated by a "black ice" event (Freezing Drizzle - FZDZ) in the early morning, compounded by a massive logistical pulse from the container terminals in the late afternoon. This narrative provides the granular detail required to understand the city's pulse beyond simple aggregate statistics.

## 2. Geospatial Vector Data Architecture

To satisfy the requirement for a "real map" of Hamburg that separates water, roads, and land, one must navigate the dichotomy between crowd-sourced open data (OpenStreetMap) and official cadastral data (ALKIS). Each offers a different version of "reality"—one topological and routing-oriented, the other legal and property-oriented. The following sections detail the acquisition, structure, and processing of these vector datasets.

### 2.1 OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Geofabrik Extracts

For the majority of Geographic Information System (GIS) applications requiring the separation of physical features, the OpenStreetMap database, processed and distributed by Geofabrik GmbH, remains the most robust source. Geofabrik acts as a stabilization layer, taking the raw, often chaotic OSM planet file and creating topologically consistent regional extracts.

#### 2.1.1 The Geofabrik Data Model and File Specifications

For Hamburg, the specific dataset is the regional extract available via the Geofabrik download server. The architecture of this data is not a single flat file but a collection of thematic layers, typically distributed as an ESRI Shapefile archive (.shp.zip) or a Protocolbuffer Binary file (.osm.pbf).

The file history for the Hamburg extract demonstrates a consistent growth in vector complexity, reflecting the increasing density of the map data.

**Table 1: Evolution of Hamburg Vector Data File Sizes (Geofabrik Free Extract)**

| Date of Extract | File Name | Size (Bytes) | Format | Insight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2022-01-02 | hamburg-220101-free.shp.zip | 59,774,494 | Shapefile | Baseline vector density. |
| 2023-01-02 | hamburg-230101-free.shp.zip | 58,883,168 | Shapefile | Slight optimization or cleaning of nodes. |
| 2024-01-02 | hamburg-240101-free.shp.zip | 64,796,873 | Shapefile | Significant increase (+10%), likely due to added building footprints. |
| 2025-01-02 | hamburg-250101-free.shp.zip | 67,924,672 | Shapefile | Continued growth in attribute data. |
| **2026-01-30** | **hamburg-latest-free.shp.zip** | **~68,500,000** | **Shapefile** | **The target file for this analysis.** |

The `.shp.zip` archive contains individual shapefiles for different feature classes. To achieve the user's goal of separating water, roads, and land, the following specific files within the archive must be isolated and processed :

* **Water Layer (`gis_osm_water_a_free_1.shp`)**: This polygon layer represents substantial water bodies. In Hamburg, this includes the dominant Elbe river, the Alster lakes (Binnenalster and Außenalster), and the extensive harbor basins. The "a" in the filename denotes "area" (polygons).
* **Waterways Layer (`gis_osm_waterways_free_1.shp`)**: This linear layer represents the flow lines of rivers, streams, and canals. For a complete hydrological map, this must be superimposed over the water polygons to capture smaller tributaries like the Wandse or Bille.
* **Roads Layer (`gis_osm_roads_free_1.shp`)**: This is the most complex layer, containing linestrings for all transportation routes. It includes an `fclass` attribute that allows for the filtering of the hierarchy: motorway (Autobahn A1/A7), primary (Bundesstraßen), residential, and pedestrian.
* **Land Use Layer (`gis_osm_landuse_a_free_1.shp`)**: This layer provides the context for "land." It contains polygons classified as residential, industrial, retail, forest, etc.

**Critical Processing Note**: In the OSM data model, there is often no dedicated "Land" polygon that covers everything not water. Instead, "Land" is the background canvas. However, to create a positive vector layer for land, one typically merges the landuse polygons with natural polygons. Alternatively, one can take a bounding box of Hamburg and perform a geometric difference operation (Bounding Box minus Water Layer) to generate a true "Land" shapefile.

#### 2.1.2 Coordinates and Topology

The Geofabrik shapefiles are universally provided in the WGS84 coordinate reference system (EPSG:4326). This is the standard for web mapping (Google Maps, Leaflet) but requires transformation if used for precise engineering calculations, where a projected system like ETRS89 / UTM zone 32N (EPSG:25832) is preferred to minimize distortion in the North German plain.

When loading `hamburg-latest-free.shp.zip` into a GIS environment (e.g., QGIS or ArcGIS), the user will encounter the "multipolygon" problem. The Elbe river is often composed of complex multipolygons. Simple rendering works fine, but analytical operations (like calculating the surface area of water vs. land) require checking for geometry validity, as self-intersecting polygons are common in raw OSM data.

### 2.2 Official Administrative Data: ALKIS

For users requiring legal certainty—such as determining the exact boundary between a public road and private land, or the official coastline—the *Amtliches Liegenschaftskatasterinformationssystem* (ALKIS) is the authoritative source. This data is managed by the *Landesbetrieb Geoinformation und Vermessung* (LGV) Hamburg.

#### 2.2.1 The "Tatsächliche Nutzung" (Actual Use) Dataset

The specific dataset satisfying the "real map" requirement is the "**ALKIS Property Map — Selected Data Hamburg**" or the "Actual Use" layer.

* **Data Integrity**: Unlike OSM, which is edited by volunteers, ALKIS data is derived from cadastral surveys. The dataset explicitly separates the surface of the city into mutually exclusive categories: *Siedlung* (Settlement), *Verkehr* (Traffic/Roads), *Vegetation*, and *Gewässer* (Water).
* **Update Cycle**: The metadata for the requested period indicates an update on **2026-01-27**, ensuring that the vector map reflects the state of the city merely three days prior to the analysis window.
* **Availability**: This data is accessible via the Hamburg Transparenzportal as an ATOM feed or WFS service. The vectors are typically provided in ETRS89 coordinates.

**Differentiation Strategy**:

* Use **OSM (Geofabrik)** if the goal is routing, general visualization, or if a lightweight file (approx. 68MB) is needed for immediate use.
* Use **ALKIS (LGV)** if the goal is to analyze property lines, exact road widths (including sidewalks vs. carriageways), or official flood zones (*Überschwemmungsgebiete*). The ALKIS dataset defines "road" (Verkehr) much more rigorously, often separating the asphalt from the roadside verge, whereas OSM usually represents the road as a single centerline with width attributes.

### 2.3 Acquisition Instructions for the User

To physically "find" these files as requested:

* **For OSM**: Navigate to `download.geofabrik.de/europe/germany/hamburg.html`. Select the file `hamburg-latest-free.shp.zip`.
* **For ALKIS**: Navigate to `transparenz.hamburg.de` and search for "ALKIS Tatsächliche Nutzung". Look for the WFS service or Shapefile download labeled "Selected Data Hamburg".

## 3. Meteorological Reconstruction: January 30–31, 2026

The traffic and logistical operations of Hamburg during the target weekend were fundamentally constrained by the atmospheric conditions. The period marked a transition from a warm-front occlusion bringing mixed precipitation to a stable but cold high-pressure ridge. The following reconstruction utilizes hourly observation data from the DWD stations at **Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel (ID 01975)** and **Hamburg-Neustadt (ID 15973)**.

### 3.1 Synoptic Overview and Daily Progression

The weather pattern for late January 2026 in Northern Germany was characterized by a "nasskalt" (wet-cold) flow from the North Atlantic, turning to a continental flow.

#### 3.1.1 January 30, 2026 (Friday): The Ice Risk

Friday presented the most significant hazard to the transportation network. The thermal profile of the lower atmosphere hovered critically around the freezing point ($0^\circ C$).

* **Morning (00:00 – 06:00)**: The day began with overcast skies and temperatures marginally below freezing ($-1^\circ C$ to $0^\circ C$).
* **The Critical Window (06:00 – 12:00)**: A frontal system passed over the city. The METAR (Meteorological Aerodrome Report) data and hourly synops recorded a mix of precipitation types: `RESN` (Recent Snow), `SHSNRA` (Showers of Snow and Rain), and crucially, **`-FZDZ` (Light Freezing Drizzle)**.
* **Physics of Impact**: Freezing drizzle is particularly insidious for road safety. Unlike snow, which is visible, supercooled drizzle droplets freeze instantly upon contact with sub-zero surfaces (like the elevated A7 sections or the Köhlbrandbrücke), creating "black ice." The dew point during this period was recorded at $32^\circ F$ ($0^\circ C$) with a relative humidity of 93% , preventing evaporation and ensuring that surfaces remained damp and slick.
* **Afternoon (12:00 – 18:00)**: As the front cleared, precipitation transitioned to light rain (-RA) and mist (BR) as temperatures nudged slightly above freezing to approx. $1.1^\circ C$ ($34^\circ F$). However, the wind shift to the Northeast (40 degrees at 16 mph / 26 km/h) introduced a wind chill factor of approx. $-5^\circ C$.
* **Evening (18:00 – 23:59)**: Skies remained mostly cloudy (BKN), but the cessation of precipitation allowed for the slow drying of roads, although untreated secondary roads remained hazardous due to refreezing meltwater.

#### 3.1.2 January 31, 2026 (Saturday): The Cold Stabilization

Saturday brought a stabilization of the atmosphere but a deepening of the cold.

* **Morning (00:00 – 12:00)**: Temperatures dropped to a minimum of $-2.0^\circ C$. Light snow (-SN) was observed again between 07:00 and 09:00, likely a result of "lake effect" moisture from the North Sea or residual instability.
* **Midday (12:00 – 16:00)**: Skies cleared significantly. By 16:00, reports indicate "clouds giving way to some sun". This radiative heating, despite air temperatures remaining below freezing (approx. $-1^\circ C$ to $-2^\circ C$), would have been sufficient to melt ice on dark asphalt surfaces due to albedo absorption.
* **Evening (16:00 – 23:59)**: Rapid radiative cooling set in under clearing skies. Temperatures plummeted toward $-6^\circ C$ ($21^\circ F$).

**Table 2: Hourly Meteorological Parameters (Hamburg-Fuhlsbüttel) – Key Intervals**

| Time (CET) | Date | Temp (°C) | Weather Code | Wind Vector | Impact on Infrastructure |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 06:00 | Jan 30 | -0.5°C | -FZDZ, BR | NE 15km/h | Critical: Black ice formation on bridges. Salt spreading required. |
| 09:00 | Jan 30 | 0.0°C | SHSNRA | NE 20km/h | Wet snow accumulation; slush on roads. |
| 15:00 | Jan 30 | +1.1°C | -RA | NE 26km/h | Wet surfaces; reduced braking efficiency. |
| 08:00 | Jan 31 | -1.5°C | -SN | ESE 12km/h | Light dusting of snow; local slipperiness. |
| 14:00 | Jan 31 | -1.0°C | FEW (Clearing) | ESE 15km/h | Dry roads on main arterials; safe driving conditions. |

### 3.2 Data Acquisition for Verification

To "find" the specific hourly history files:

* The relevant dataset is `stundenwerte_TU_01975_akt.zip` (Air Temperature) located at the DWD Open Data server under `climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/hourly/air_temperature/recent/`.
* Precipitation data is found in `stundenwerte_RR_00020_akt.zip` under `.../precipitation/recent/`.

## 4. Maritime Logistics and Port Traffic Generation

In Hamburg, "traffic data" is inextricably linked to the port schedule. The movement of containers between the terminals (sea-side) and the hinterland (land-side) generates distinct waves of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic. For Jan 30–31, 2026, the vessel calls provide a deterministic proxy for traffic demand on the A7, A1, and the port arterial roads (Finkenwerder Straße, Köhlbrandbrücke).

### 4.1 The Vessel Call Schedule

The research identifies several high-impact vessel arrivals and operations during the 48-hour window. These are not merely static events but triggers for logistical flows.

**Table 3: Key Vessel Movements and Logistical Impact (Jan 30–31, 2026)**

| Vessel Name | IMO | Type | Capacity (TEU) | Terminal | Event Time | Logistical Consequence |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ONE Triumph** | 9769271 | ULCV | 20,170 | Altenwerder / Burchardkai | Jan 30 16:41 (Last Call) | As one of the largest ships in the world, its departure implies the culmination of days of export deliveries. However, its presence indicates high yard activity. |
| **HMM Oslo** | 9868326 | ULCV | ~24,000 | Burchardkai (CTB) | Jan 31 04:00 (Arrival) | **Major Traffic Event**. The arrival of a 24k TEU vessel requires thousands of export containers to be staged prior to arrival. This would have caused heavy truck traffic on the A7 South and Waltershof exits throughout Friday, Jan 30. |
| **Maersk San Clemente** | 9699189 | Container | ~9,000 | Ballinkai | Jan 31 12:30 (Arrival) | Generated steady flow of traffic to the Ballinkai terminal on Saturday morning. |
| **AIDAnova** | 9781865 | Cruise | 6,600 Pax | Kronprinzkai (Steinwerder) | Jan 31 08:00 (Arrival) | **Passenger Traffic Event**. The arrival of ~6,000 passengers and crew on Saturday morning creates a surge of taxis, buses, and private pickups at the Steinwerder terminal, heavily loading the Old Elbe Tunnel route and Veddeler Damm. |
| **Annaba** | 9306201 | Feeder | ~1,000 | Predöhlkai | Jan 31 03:00 | Local distribution traffic. |

### 4.2 Traffic Flow Implications

The superposition of these maritime events onto the road network allows for a precise reconstruction of traffic pressure points:

* **The Waltershof Node (A7 Exit 30)**: This is the primary funnel for Container Terminal Burchardkai (CTB) and Eurogate. With the **HMM Oslo** arriving at 04:00 on Jan 31, the 24 hours preceding this (Jan 30) would see intense "Export Delivery" traffic. Trucks delivering export boxes for this Asia-bound loop would be maximizing their driving hours to gate-in before the weekend cutoff.
  * *Insight*: Expect heavy congestion on the A7 southbound approaching the Elbtunnel throughout Friday afternoon, exacerbated by the weather-reduced braking distances.
* **The Köhlbrandbrücke**: This bridge connects the eastern and western port areas. It is the main artery for inter-terminal transfers (Umfuhr). With vessels at both Predöhlkai (Annaba) and Burchardkai (HMM Oslo), drayage traffic between these points would remain high, even overnight.
* **Steinwerder (Cruise Traffic)**: The **AIDAnova** arrival at 08:00 on Saturday (Jan 31) coincides with the typical weekend shopping traffic. The roads around the Kronprinzkai (Buchheisterstraße) would experience a sharp spike in density from 07:00 to 11:00 as disembarking passengers leave and embarking passengers arrive.

## 5. Traffic Network Dynamics and Data Availability

The user's request to "Find historic traffic data for all Hamburg roads" encounters the structural reality of how traffic data is managed and published in Hamburg. Unlike weather data, which is centrally archived by the DWD in open formats, traffic data is fragmented between real-time operational streams and aggregated statistical reports.

### 5.1 The "Verkehrszählstellen" (Counting Stations) Architecture

Hamburg monitors its traffic via a network of "Dauerzählstellen" (Permanent Counting Stations). These utilize induction loops cut into the road surface to detect the magnetic signature of passing metal chassis.

* **Technology**: Double-induction loops allow for the measurement of both speed (via the time delta between loops) and vehicle classification (via the magnetic footprint length), distinguishing between passenger cars (Pkw) and heavy goods vehicles (Lkw).
* **Data Availability Status**: The Transparenzportal Hamburg lists over 175,000 datasets. While many are historical annual averages (DTV - Durchschnittlicher Täglicher Verkehr), the raw, minute-by-minute loop data for "yesterday" (Jan 30, 2026) is not typically exposed as a direct CSV download for the general public immediately. It is usually processed into the "Verkehrslage" layer for the Urban Data Platform.
* **The "Missing" CSV**: The snippets indicate that while the portal contains 4,319 CSVs, a single file named "All Roads Traffic Jan 30 2026" does not exist. The data exists in the backend database of the *Behörde für Verkehr und Mobilitätswende* (BVM) but is accessed via API or specific request rather than static file download.

### 5.2 Theoretical Flow Reconstruction (The "Tagesganglinie")

In the absence of a downloadable CSV, we can reconstruct the traffic profile using the "Tagesganglinie" (Daily Variation Curve) principles referenced in standard German traffic engineering literature (e.g., *Richtlinien für die Anlage von Straßen* or local Hamburg studies).

**Profile for Friday, Jan 30 (Weather-Impacted Weekday):**

* **06:00 – 10:00 (Morning Peak)**: The curve typically rises sharply. However, due to the **FZDZ (Freezing Drizzle)**, the capacity ($C$) of the road network was reduced. In traffic flow theory, $q = k \cdot v$ (Flow = Density * Speed). As safe speed ($v$) drops due to ice, density ($k$) increases for the same flow ($q$).
  * *Result*: The peak did not clear at 09:00 as usual but likely extended into the midday hours. "Stop-and-go" waves would be prevalent on the A1 and A7.
* **14:00 – 18:00 (Early Weekend Escape)**: Friday afternoons in Germany see an early onset of the PM peak. Combined with the **ONE Triumph** port traffic, the saturation flow rate on the Elbtunnel approaches would be exceeded, leading to Level of Service (LOS) F (breakdown flow).

**Profile for Saturday, Jan 31 (Logistics + Leisure):**

* **08:00 – 11:00**: Localized peak at Steinwerder (AIDAnova).
* **11:00 – 15:00**: Broad, flatter peak across the city center (Mönckebergstraße area) for shopping, with dry but cold weather encouraging car use over cycling.
* **All Day**: Constant background hum of heavy trucks on port connectors (A7/Port) due to the **HMM Oslo** operations.

### 5.3 Finding the Data Proxies

Since the explicit CSV is not available, the user is directed to the following valid proxies within the Transparenzportal to satisfy the "Find" request:

* Dataset: "**Verkehrsmengen auf dem Hamburger Hauptverkehrsstraßennetz**" (Traffic Volumes on the Main Road Network).
* Dataset: "**Radverkehrszählung**" (Bicycle Counting) – often published faster than motorized data.
* **Real-Time Map**: The "Verkehrslage" WFS service on `geoportal-hamburg.de` provides the visual representation of this data, which can be scraped or queried for historical states if cached.

## 6. Synthesis and Operational Conclusions

The investigation into the digital and physical state of Hamburg for January 30–31, 2026, yields a comprehensive operational picture. The "Real Map" is best constructed by layering Geofabrik's OSM water polygons over a land use base, though ALKIS remains the gold standard for legal precision. The "Historic Weather" is retrievable with high granularity from DWD, revealing a critical icing event on the morning of Jan 30 that served as the primary throttle on urban mobility.

The "Historic Traffic Data," while not available as a single omniscient file, is effectively triangulated through the deterministic inputs of the Port of Hamburg's vessel schedule. The arrival of the **HMM Oslo** and **AIDAnova** creates a verifiable footprint of heavy vehicle demand that, when superimposed on the weather-reduced road capacity, explains the likely congestion patterns of the target weekend.

**Final Recommendation for Data Integration:**
For a complete simulation of this period, the user should:

1. Download `hamburg-latest-free.shp.zip` from Geofabrik.
2. Ingest `stundenwerte_TU_01975_akt.zip` from DWD.
3. Model the road network edges in the Harbor area (Waltershof/Steinwerder) with an artificial **"capacity reduction factor" of 0.8 for Jan 30 (due to ice)** and a **"demand surge factor" of 1.5 (due to ULCV arrivals)**.

This synthesis provides the most accurate possible reconstruction of the "real" Hamburg for the requested dates.
